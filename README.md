Exam Center Allocation System.
Here's how it works:

User Registration: Users need to register with their username and email address to participate in the exam. 

Exam Centre Allocation: When a user registers or requests an exam center allocation, the system checks whether the user already exists in the database. If the user is already registered with the same username and email, the system does not allocate a new exam center to them, ensuring that each user has a single allocated center.

Random Allocation: For new users or users without an allocated center, the system randomly selects an available exam center from a list. This random allocation ensures fairness and diversity in center assignments.

Notifications: After the allocation process, the system can notify users of their assigned exam center through email or other means, ensuring they have the necessary information for the exam day.

Overall, this JavaScript Small Exam Centre Allocation system streamlines the allocation process, prevents duplicate allocations for the same user, and ensures a fair and random assignment of exam centers, enhancing the efficiency and integrity of the exam administration process.
